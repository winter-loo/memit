# Design System: Word Detail Overlay - Modern Style

**Project ID:** 5460675974111516061

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

The design embodies a **Sophisticated Dark Academic** aesthetic. It is focused,
utilitarian, and high-density, designed to present complex linguistic
information without overwhelming the user. The atmosphere is "Focused" and
"Intellectual," utilizing deep midnight tones to minimize eye strain during
long study sessions.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

- **Vivid Amber Primary (#FF8C00):** Used for primary actions, accents, and high-visibility status indicators. It provides a sharp contrast against the dark background.
- **Deep Midnight Background (#0D151D):** The foundational base color for the entire interface, creating a deep, immersive environment.
- **Slate Navy Card Base (#111A24):** Used for content containers and cards to create subtle depth and separation from the main background.
- **Muted Steel Border (#1E2E3D):** Provides low-contrast structural definition for borders and dividers, maintaining a clean layout without visual noise.

## 3. Typography Rules

The system uses **Lexend** as its primary typeface, chosen for its hyper-legibility and clean, geometric character.

- **Headings:** Bold weights are used for the main word being studied, emphasizing its importance.
- **Subheadings:** Medium weights in muted tones are used for section headers like "Etymology" or "Synonyms."
- **Body Content:** Regular weights with generous line-height ensure that definitions and etymological notes are easy to digest.

## 4. Component Stylings

- **Action Buttons:** Feature **Subtly rounded corners (0.5rem / 8px)** and use the Vivid Amber primary color for high-intent actions (like "Save" or "Translate").
- **Word Detail Cards:** These use **Generously rounded corners (0.75rem / 12px)** and a dark slate background to group related linguistic data into cohesive units.
- **Phonetic Badges:** Often pill-shaped or subtly rounded, providing a distinct visual container for pronunciation guides.
- **Dividers:** Ultra-thin strokes in the Muted Steel color, used to separate semantic sections within a single card.

## 5. Layout Principles

The interface follows a **Modular Grid** strategy with a focus on "Vertical Hierarchy." Information is stacked semantically (Word -> Definition -> Context -> Origin), with consistent 1rem to 1.5rem padding between major content blocks to ensure breathing room despite the high information density.
